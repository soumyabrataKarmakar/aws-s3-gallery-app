# Product Mission

## Pitch

AWS S3 Gallery is a mobile gallery application that helps individual users upload and organize their media files by providing unlimited cloud storage through their own AWS S3 bucket with transparent real-time cost tracking.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Individual Users**: People who need unlimited media storage without subscription limits
- **Cost-Conscious Users**: Users who want full control over their cloud storage expenses

### User Personas

**Tech-Savvy Individual** (25-45 years old)
- **Role:** Professional/Enthusiast Photographer or Content Creator
- **Context:** Managing large volumes of photos and videos for personal or professional use
- **Pain Points:** Limited storage on current cloud solutions, expensive subscription plans, lack of cost transparency
- **Goals:** Unlimited storage capacity, cost control, easy media organization

## The Problem

### Limited Cloud Storage Subscriptions

Current cloud solutions restrict users with subscription-based storage limits, forcing expensive upgrades when storage needs grow. Users lose control over their data and face unpredictable costs.

**Our Solution:** Direct AWS S3 integration gives users unlimited storage at actual AWS rates.

### Lack of Storage Cost Transparency

Most cloud gallery services hide the true cost of storage and transfers, making it difficult for users to budget and optimize their usage.

**Our Solution:** Real-time cost tracking shows exactly what each upload, download, and storage operation costs.

### Poor Media Organization Tools

Traditional cloud services provide basic folder structures without advanced organization features tailored for media files.

**Our Solution:** Gallery-optimized organization that syncs with S3 folder structure for seamless media management.

## Differentiators

### Direct AWS Integration

Unlike Google Photos or iCloud, we provide direct access to your own AWS S3 bucket, giving you full control over your data and costs without subscription limits.

### Real-Time Cost Tracking

Unlike traditional cloud storage services, we show transparent, real-time AWS costs for every operation, helping users optimize their usage and budget effectively.

### Pay-As-You-Use Model

Unlike fixed subscription plans, users only pay AWS for what they actually use, potentially saving significant money compared to traditional cloud storage services.
