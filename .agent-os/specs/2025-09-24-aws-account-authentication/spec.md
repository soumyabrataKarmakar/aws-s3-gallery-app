# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: AWS Account Authentication
> Created: 2025-09-24

## Overview

Implement secure AWS account authentication using AWS Cognito to enable users to connect their AWS accounts and access S3 services. This foundational feature provides the security layer required for all subsequent AWS S3 operations and ensures users can safely manage their media files through the application.

## User Stories

### First-Time User Authentication

As a new user, I want to securely connect my AWS account to the gallery app, so that I can store and manage my media files using my own S3 storage.

The user opens the app for the first time and is presented with a welcome screen explaining the benefits of using their own AWS S3 storage. They tap "Connect AWS Account" which launches the AWS Cognito authentication flow. The user enters their AWS credentials through the secure AWS login interface, grants necessary permissions for S3 access, and receives confirmation that their account is successfully connected. The app then navigates to the main gallery interface.

### Returning User Authentication

As a returning user, I want to quickly and securely access my gallery without re-entering my AWS credentials every time, so that I can efficiently manage my media files.

When a returning user opens the app, the authentication system automatically checks for stored secure tokens. If valid tokens exist, the user is immediately taken to their gallery. If tokens have expired, the user is prompted for re-authentication through a streamlined flow that leverages stored account information while maintaining security standards.

### Account Disconnection

As a user, I want to safely disconnect my AWS account from the app, so that I can revoke access when needed for security purposes.

The user navigates to the settings screen and selects "Disconnect AWS Account." The app displays a confirmation dialog explaining the consequences (loss of access to stored media until reconnection). Upon confirmation, the app securely clears all stored authentication tokens, revokes permissions where possible, and returns the user to the initial welcome screen.

## Spec Scope

1. **AWS Cognito Integration** - Implement secure authentication flow using AWS Cognito User Pools and Identity Pools
2. **Token Management** - Handle secure storage and refresh of authentication tokens with automatic renewal
3. **Permission Verification** - Verify user has necessary IAM permissions for S3 operations after authentication
4. **Session Management** - Maintain user session state across app launches with secure token validation
5. **Account Disconnection** - Provide secure logout functionality that properly revokes access and clears stored credentials

## Out of Scope

- Multi-account support (single AWS account per user for MVP)
- Social media authentication (AWS-only for this spec)
- Advanced IAM role management and configuration
- Offline authentication or cached credentials for extended periods

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can successfully authenticate with their AWS account through a secure Cognito flow and access the main gallery interface
2. Authenticated users remain logged in across app sessions until tokens expire or they manually disconnect
3. Users can safely disconnect their AWS account, which properly revokes access and returns them to the unauthenticated state
